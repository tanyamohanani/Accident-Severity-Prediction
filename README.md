# Accident Severity Identification

This project undertakes the task of predicting the severity of road accidents on a scale of 1 to 4 through the application of advanced machine learning techniques. By harnessing a diverse range of features including weather conditions, location attributes, temporal characteristics, and other relevant parameters, the project endeavors to furnish valuable insights for understanding and preemptively addressing factors contributing to accident severity.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The project commences with the meticulous loading of a comprehensive dataset encompassing a wide spectrum of accident-related information. Thorough data cleaning processes are employed to handle missing values and prune extraneous columns, ensuring data integrity.

- **Feature Engineering:** Elevating the predictive capability of the models is accomplished by crafting new features. This entails categorizing intricate weather conditions into meaningful clusters and extracting temporal components from the accident timestamps.

- **Mitigating Class Imbalance:** Effectively addressing the challenge of class imbalance in accident severity classification, the project leverages sophisticated sampling methodologies encompassing both undersampling and oversampling techniques to forge a balanced dataset, thereby enhancing the model's discriminatory capacity.

- **Model Selection and Training:** Two potent machine learning models, namely XGBoost and Decision Tree, are judiciously selected for training. These models undergo comprehensive training and fine-tuning processes, assimilating insights from the dataset to aptly predict accident severity.

- **Evaluation and Visual Analytics:** The performance of the predictive models is diligently evaluated employing an array of performance metrics. A visual representation of the confusion matrix serves to illuminate the models' effectiveness in prediction.
